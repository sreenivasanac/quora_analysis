PROJECT: Quora Answer Scraper for Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam
OBJECTIVE:
Build a comprehensive Scrapy spider to extract all 28,000+ answers from Quora user "Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam" and store them in PostgreSQL.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
Framework & Language:

Python with Scrapy framework
PostgreSQL database for storage
Google OAuth authentication for Quora login
Session/cookie persistence for authenticated scraping

Authentication Setup:

Login via Google OAuth using email: sreenivasan.ac92@gmail.com
Maintain persistent session throughout scraping process
Handle cookie management and session renewal

Entry Point:
Start URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Kanthaswamy-Balasubramaniam/answers
DATA EXTRACTION WORKFLOW:

Answer Discovery:

For each of the question answer in Quora website link above, Extract individual answer links using: response.css("a.answer_timestamp::attr(href)").get()

Keep scrolling in the quora page till the end to get all 28,000+ such links. Store the answer links in postgresql in the database field answered_question_url . Give an database ID during each insertion. Keep the other fields empty for now.


Please create a production-ready spider that handles authentication, data extraction, and storage robustly.

QUORA ANSWER PROCESSOR - DATABASE POPULATION
OBJECTIVE:
Process existing answered_question_url entries in the PostgreSQL database and populate all missing fields by scraping detailed answer data.

This is the database table schema:
DATABASE SCHEMA (PostgreSQL):
CREATE TABLE quora_answers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    question_url TEXT,
    answered_question_url TEXT,        -- Source URLs to process
    question_text TEXT,
    answer_content TEXT,               -- Markdown converted content
    revision_link TEXT,
    post_timestamp_raw TEXT,           -- Raw timestamp string
    post_timestamp_parsed TIMESTAMP    -- Parsed datetime with timezone
);
DELIVERABLES

Enhanced Scrapy Spider - Process existing database entries
Timestamp Parser - Robust datetime conversion with timezone handling
Database Updater - Efficient batch updates with error handling
Progress Monitor - Real-time processing status and logging
Data Validator - Ensure data integrity before database updates

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

Implement robust error handling and retry logic
Add respectful delays between requests (0.3 second)
Log progress every 100 answers processed
Save data incrementally to avoid data loss
Handle dynamic content loading and pagination
Implement graceful shutdown and resume capability

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:

Runtime: 8 - 10 hours is acceptable
Concurrent requests: 1-3 (be respectful to Quora's servers)
Data integrity: All 28,000+ answers must be captured

DELIVERABLES:

Complete Scrapy spider with authentication
PostgreSQL database setup script
Data validation and progress monitoring
Error handling and logging system


DATA EXTRACTION WORKFLOW
Phase 1: Main Answer Page Processing
For each answered_question_url in the database, we want to populate the other values in quora_answers table.

For each of the question answer, the value of the corresponding is given as:

Question URL:
question_url = response.css(".puppeteer_test_question_title a::attr(href)").get()

Question Text:
question_text = response.css(".puppeteer_test_question_title a::text").get()

Answer Content:
answer_content = response.css("div.q-text span::text").get()

Convert HTML to Markdown format
Convert images to their URLs
Use html2text or similar library for conversion, sample code as follows:

# Convert to markdown using html-to-markdown library
html-to-markdown library instruction given in this file @html_to_markdown_library_instrn.txt 

Revision Log Data:

For each answer answered_question_url link, construct log URL and extract revision data:
Construct Log URL:
log_url = f"{answered_question_url}/log"

Visit this log URL, and then from the dom selector, extract the values for the following:
Extract Revision Link:
revision_link = response.css("a.puppeteer_test_link::attr(href)").get()

Extract Post Raw Timestamp:
post_timestamp_raw = response.css("span.c1h7helg.c8970ew:last-child::text").get()

Phase 3: Timestamp Parsing
Convert raw timestamp strings to proper datetime format:

post_timestamp_parsed Post Timestamp Parsed: 
Take the value of post_timestamp_raw, which will be string value like "June 27, 2025 at 10:26:56 PM"
Convert this to datetime format, and save it in the database. It should properly be in datetime format. Keep a consistent time zone.
Sample code:

from datetime import datetime
import pytz

def parse_quora_timestamp(timestamp_str):
    """
    Convert "June 27, 2025 at 10:26:56 PM" to datetime object
    """
    try:
        # Parse the timestamp string
        dt = datetime.strptime(timestamp_str, "%B %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S %p")
        
        # Set timezone (assuming Pacific Time for Quora)
        pacific = pytz.timezone('US/Pacific')
        dt_with_tz = pacific.localize(dt)
        
        return dt_with_tz
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing timestamp: {timestamp_str}")
        return None


Update the above values back to the table quora_answers for those rows.
# Update query template
UPDATE_QUERY = """
UPDATE quora_answers 
SET question_url = %s,
    question_text = %s,
    answer_content = %s,
    revision_link = %s,
    post_timestamp_raw = %s,
    post_timestamp_parsed = %s
WHERE answered_question_url = %s
"""



Error Handling:

Skip and log failed URL processing
Continue processing remaining URLs
Implement retry logic for network failures
Validate data before database insertion

Progress Tracking:

Log every 50 processed entries
Save progress to resume interrupted runs
Track success/failure rates
Estimate completion time

Rate Limiting:

2-3 second delays between requests
Respect Quora's rate limits
Handle 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
